HELLO,

THIS FILE IS DEDICATED TO THE SOPHISTICATION PRESENTED IN THE ARDUOUS JOURNEY TO DECIPHER THE MOST IMPORTANT ELEMENTS TO HUMAN EXISTENCE; NAMES.

THE FIRST QUERY SEEKS TO UNDERSTAND THE PROGRESSION OF THE MEANING OF WORDS, “GAY”, IN THE MODERN ERA REFERS TO SOMEONE WHO IS OF HOMOSEXUAL NATURE. HOWEVER, IN OLD TIMES, IT REFERS TO ONE WHO IS BLISSFUL AND HAPPY. THERE WERE PLENTY MORE OF PEOPLE WHO HAD “GAY” IN THEIR NAMES COMPARED TO THE MORE RECENTLY.

THE SECOND QUERY SEEKS TO UNDERSTAND THE VAST CONTRIBUTIONS THE DIFFERENT STATES OF THE USA HAVE PROVIDED TOWARDS THE TOTAL NUMBER OF DATA POINTS IN THIS PROJECT. CALIFORNIA, UNSURPRISED, PROVIDED WITH THE MOST DATA POINTS, WITH ARKANSAS BEING DEAD LAST AT PROVIDING 15 TIMES LESS DATA THAN CALIFORNIA DID.

THE THIRD QUERY SEEKS TO UNDERSTAND THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE BORN WITH THE NAMES LARRY, AND JOHNSON. BOTH NAMES THOUGH TRADITIONALLY MASCULINE, CAN ALSO BE A NAME FOR A GIRL. THE QUERY SEEKS TO UNDERSTAND WHICH NAME HAS THE MOST SURPRISING AFFILIATIONS OF GENDER, AND IT APPEARS TO BE LARRY, THE NAME WITH THE MORE EQUAL RATIO OF GENDERS.

THE THIRD QUERY SEEKS TO COMPARE THE TOTAL CONTRIBUTIONS OF NAMES BETWEEN THE STATES AND NATION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. IT IS SHOWN THAT COMPARED TO THE FEDERAL NATION OF AMERICA, THE STATES WERE INCOMPARIBLE AND PUNY.

THE LAST QUERY SEEKS TO UNDERSTAND A VERY SIMPLE BUT IMPORT QUESTION, HOW MANY SAMANTHA(S) WERE BORN IN 1945 AND IS FEMALE. THIS IS EASILY PROVEN AND THE ANSWER IS 31 THANKS TO THE INNOVATION OF TECHNOLOGY.

OVERALL THIS QUERY WAS A HUGE INSIGHT AND IT BENEFITS THE ENLIGHTENMENT OF MANKIND VERY MUCH. THANK YOU!!!
